What is Vehicle-Fits?
---------------------
Vehicle Fits is an extension to add automotive features to your Magento or Prestashop shopping cart. We install either shopping cart for you, as well as install the Vehicle Fits extension itself. Once your shopping cart has the Vehicle Fits extension installed, you will have hundreds of automotive features including a year/make/model search.
The year/make/model search can be customized in 50+ ways, including the ability to change the number, order, or names of the select box. For example if you want to add a select box called "engine", or remove the select box called "year" you can do so. You can have as few as two select boxes, or as many as you'd like.
You can import your existing data, or use Vehicle Fits to create your own data using our vehicle databases.
